# Assessment: Object classification in Images

You can work on the assignment in one of two ways: locally on your own machine, or on a virtual machine on Google Colab.

## Working remotely on Google Cloud (Recommended)

As part of this unit, you are recommended to use Google Colab for your assessment. It is recommended for anyone who is having trouble with installation set-up, or if you would like to use better CPU/GPU resources than you may have locally. I highly recommend using Google Colab with GPU support by selecting GPU in runtime type since your training will go much faster than this.

Please see the Google Colab GPU [set-up](https://towardsdatascience.com/getting-started-with-google-colab-f2fff97f594c) tutorial here for instructions.
